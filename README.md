[![CI](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-sysaudio/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-sysaudio/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/oxideav-sysaudio.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/oxideav-sysaudio) [![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/oxideav-sysaudio/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/oxideav-sysaudio) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Pure-Rust audio output for the `oxideav` workspace. Every native audio
API is loaded at runtime through `libloading`, so the produced binary
has **no** audio library listed in its ELF `NEEDED` entries (or the
Windows / macOS equivalents). No dev headers are required at build
time either — `cargo build` works on any platform regardless of which
audio SDK is installed.

## FreeBSD OSS

FreeBSD uses the kernel OSS API directly. The backend opens `/dev/dsp` (or a
caller-selected `/dev/dspN`), negotiates signed 16-bit little-endian PCM with
`SNDCTL_DSP_SETFMT`, then sets channels and sample rate through the native
FreeBSD ioctl encoding before running the ordinary worker/callback loop. The
implementation does not reuse Linux ioctl numbers or request packing.

Like the other backends, the libc entry points are resolved at runtime, so
adding FreeBSD OSS support does not add a link-time audio dependency.

## Backends

| Target  | Backend   | Status      | Shared object                                                                 |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | PipeWire  | Stub        | `libpipewire-0.3.so.0` (not yet wired)                                        |
| Linux   | PulseAudio| Functional  | `libpulse-simple.so.0`                                                        |
| Linux   | ALSA      | Functional  | `libasound.so.2`                                                              |
| Linux   | OSS       | Functional  | `/dev/dsp` via dlopen'd libc (`open`/`close`/`write`/`ioctl`)                 |
| FreeBSD | OSS       | **Functional** | native OSS `/dev/dsp*` ABI via dlopen'd libc; S16_LE negotiation              |
| Windows | WASAPI    | Functional  | `ole32.dll` + `kernel32.dll` (COM vtables invoked by hand, shared-mode)       |
| Windows | ASIO      | Stub        | Vendor-supplied DLLs under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\ASIO` (not yet wired)               |
| macOS   | CoreAudio | Functional  | `AudioToolbox.framework` (AudioQueue API)                                     |
| any     | Mock      | Test-only   | none — virtual discard/capture sink (non-default cargo feature `mock`)       |

`probe()` returns the subset of these whose shared object loads AND
whose dummy-open succeeds, in the documented preference order:

- Linux: PipeWire → PulseAudio → ALSA → OSS
- FreeBSD: OSS
- Windows: WASAPI → ASIO
- macOS: CoreAudio

Stubbed backends fail `probe()` cleanly so auto-selection falls through
to the next working backend. OSS is last in the Linux preference order
because on modern distros `/dev/dsp` is often supplied by an OSS-emulator
sitting on top of ALSA. On FreeBSD, OSS is the native system audio ABI and
is the normal backend rather than a compatibility fallback.

`Driver::is_stub()` reports whether a backend ships as a placeholder
(PipeWire, ASIO) versus a working implementation whose shared library
may or may not be installed on this host. The two cases look identical
through `probe()` alone — both fail — so callers iterating `drivers()`
to surface a per-backend UI label can use the compile-time flag to tell
"not yet implemented" apart from "library not installed".

`Driver::status()` composes all of that into one call — and, unlike
`probe()`, keeps hold of *why* a backend is unusable:

```rust
for d in oxideav_sysaudio::drivers() {
    // "ready" | "not yet implemented (stub)" | "unavailable: <probe error>"
    println!("{:10} {}", d.name(), d.status());
}
```

`DriverStatus::Unavailable(e)` carries the probe failure `probe()`
swallows: a `LibraryLoad` means the shared library isn't installed, a
`DeviceOpen` means the library loads but no device opens (headless
box, sound server down). Probing opens a throw-away handle, so call
`status()` for diagnostics/UI, not per audio period.

## Usage

```rust
use oxideav_sysaudio::{open_default, StreamRequest};

let req = StreamRequest::new(48_000, 2);
let mut stream = open_default(req, |out, _info| {
    out.fill(0.0); // silence
})?;
// Streams start in the playing state — the callback is already
// running. pause()/play() toggle it; is_playing() reports the last
// requested transport state.
stream.pause()?;
stream.play()?;
```

Requests no backend could satisfy (`sample_rate == 0`,
`channels == 0`, `buffer_frames == Some(0)`) are rejected up front
with `Error::UnsupportedFormat`, uniformly across backends, before any
shared library is loaded.

Explicit driver selection:

```rust
let d = oxideav_sysaudio::driver_by_name("alsa")
    .ok_or("alsa not compiled in")?;
let stream = oxideav_sysaudio::open(d, req, callback)?;
```

## Device enumeration

`Driver::output_devices()` (or the free function
`oxideav_sysaudio::output_devices(driver)`) lists the playback devices
the backend can see, each as a `Device { id, name, is_default }`:

```rust
let d = oxideav_sysaudio::default_driver().ok_or("no driver")?;
for dev in d.output_devices()? {
    let tag = if dev.is_default { " (default)" } else { "" };
    println!("{}{tag}  [{}]", dev.name, dev.id);
}
```

- `id` is the backend-native opaque token (an ALSA PCM name like
  `plughw:CARD=PCH,DEV=0`, a WASAPI endpoint id, a CoreAudio numeric
  `AudioDeviceID`). Treat it as opaque; do not parse it.
- `name` is the OS-friendly label shown in the sound settings.
- Exactly one entry in a non-empty list has `is_default == true` — the
  device a plain `open_default()` plays through.

| Target  | Backend   | Enumeration source                                                         |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linux   | ALSA      | `snd_device_name_hint("pcm")`, filtered to `IOID=Output`/duplex            |
| Windows | WASAPI    | `IMMDeviceEnumerator::EnumAudioEndpoints(eRender, ACTIVE)` + `PKEY_Device_FriendlyName` |
| macOS   | CoreAudio | HAL `kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices`, kept where output streams exist       |

Backends that currently only expose default-device playback (the
PulseAudio "simple" API and OSS) and the not-yet-wired stubs (PipeWire,
ASIO) return an **empty list** rather than an error, so a caller can union
device lists across every probed driver without per-backend special-casing.

`Driver::default_output_device()` is the one-call shortcut for the
common "where does the system play right now?" query — it returns the
entry from the enumeration whose `is_default` is set, without forcing
the caller to materialise the full list and filter:

```rust
let d = oxideav_sysaudio::default_driver().ok_or("no driver")?;
if let Some(dev) = d.default_output_device()? {
    println!("default sink: {} [{}]", dev.name, dev.id);
}
```

Backends without an enumeration path (PulseAudio simple API, stubs)
surface `Ok(None)` rather than an error, matching `output_devices()`
so an iterating caller can union per-driver results.

## Software volume

`Stream::set_volume(f32)` / `Stream::volume()` — a per-stream gain
stage between the callback and the backend. `1.0` (default) is unity
gain and bypasses the multiply entirely; `0.0` is silence; values
above `1.0` amplify and may clip; negative/NaN clamp to `0.0`. The
gain lives in an atomic the audio thread reads wait-free, so
`set_volume` is safe to call from a UI thread at any rate. It is
independent of the OS mixer volume and composes with it.

## Latency reporting

`Stream::latency()` returns an `Option<Duration>` describing how long a
submitted sample takes to reach the user's ears. Use it to compensate
A/V sync when the output sink has non-trivial delay (Bluetooth,
network PulseAudio, HDMI passthrough, etc.):

| Backend   | Source                                                                             | BT/Network-aware |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| PulseAudio| `pa_simple_get_latency` (end-to-end, server-side)                                  | Yes              |
| ALSA      | `snd_pcm_delay` (driver queue depth)                                               | Partial          |
| OSS       | Worker-side period buffering (`period_frames / sample_rate`)                       | No               |
| WASAPI    | Live `IAudioClock::GetPosition` vs. frames-written delta (end-to-end, includes the device hardware pipeline). Falls back to `GetStreamLatency` + live `GetCurrentPadding` if the driver shim doesn't implement `IAudioClock`. | Yes              |
| CoreAudio | `num_buffers × period` + HAL (`kAudioDevicePropertyLatency` + buffer frame size + safety offset + stream latency) | Yes              |

## Features

All backends are enabled by default. Disabling a feature omits the
module entirely — useful for minimising binary size on platforms
where, e.g., you know you'll never need PulseAudio.

## Opening a specific device

`StreamRequest::with_device(id)` (or the lower-level `StreamRequest`
`device` field) binds the stream to a specific enumerated endpoint,
identified by the opaque `id` returned in `Device::id` by the same
backend's `output_devices()` call. The free `open_on(driver, &device,
req, cb)` is the natural shortcut when you already have a `Device`
in hand:

```rust
let d = oxideav_sysaudio::default_driver().ok_or("no driver")?;
for dev in d.output_devices()? {
    if dev.name.contains("USB Headset") {
        let req = oxideav_sysaudio::StreamRequest::new(48_000, 2);
        let stream = oxideav_sysaudio::open_on(d, &dev, req, |out, _| {
            out.fill(0.0);
        })?;
        // ... play through the USB headset specifically ...
        break;
    }
}
```

| Backend   | Per-device routing                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ALSA      | `id` is the PCM name; passed straight to `snd_pcm_open`.                        |
| OSS       | `id` is the character-device path (e.g. `/dev/dsp1`, `/dev/dsp_hw0`); `None` opens `/dev/dsp`. |
| PulseAudio| `id` is a sink name; passed as the `dev` arg of `pa_simple_new`.                |
| WASAPI    | `id` is the LPWSTR endpoint id; resolved via `IMMDeviceEnumerator::GetDevice`.  |
| CoreAudio | `id` is the decimal `AudioDeviceID`; HAL `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceUID` yields the CFString, then `AudioQueueSetProperty(kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentDevice, &cfstr)` binds the queue. `latency()` follows the bound device. |

Leaving `device` as `None` (the default constructor) opens the system
default endpoint, matching the historical `open()` / `open_default()`
behaviour.

## Buffer-size hint

`StreamRequest::with_buffer_frames(Some(n))` (or the underlying
`buffer_frames: Option<u32>` field) hands every functional backend a
period-size target measured in frames. The hint is advisory — each
backend translates it into its native unit and the OS / driver / mix
engine may clamp it to a supported value. Leaving it as `None`
preserves the historical backend defaults (roughly 20 ms across the
board).

| Backend   | Per-backend routing of `buffer_frames`                                                                                  |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ALSA      | `snd_pcm_hw_params_set_period_size_near` with the hint; buffer set to `4 × period`.                                     |
| OSS       | Worker write size = the hint; OSS has no separate period ioctl in the historic UAPI surface, so the per-`write` size IS the period. `None` keeps the historical ~20 ms target (`sample_rate / 50`, floored at 64 frames). |
| PulseAudio| Filled into a `pa_buffer_attr` (`tlength = frames × bytes_per_frame`, `minreq` ≈ one period and capped at `tlength`); other fields stay `(uint32_t)-1`. Worker write size follows the hint so client and server stay aligned. |
| WASAPI    | Translated to `REFERENCE_TIME` (100 ns ticks) via `frames × 10_000_000 / sample_rate` with i128 widening; passed as `hnsBufferDuration` to `IAudioClient::Initialize`. WASAPI clamps below the device's minimum period. |
| CoreAudio | `kAudioQueueProperty_NumberOfBuffers` × buffer size derived from the hint.                                              |

Sub-millisecond hints round up to at least one tick on WASAPI; massive
hints saturate rather than overflow.

## Sample-rate negotiation read-back

`Driver::preferred_format(Option<&Device>)` reports what `open()` would
agree on for an unconstrained request, without committing a stream.
Callers use it to resample once on their side and skip the OS mixer's
hidden conversion path:

```rust
let d = oxideav_sysaudio::default_driver().ok_or("no driver")?;
if let Some(fmt) = d.preferred_format(None)? {
    // Resample our 44.1 kHz pipeline to fmt.sample_rate before open().
    println!("native: {} Hz, {} ch", fmt.sample_rate, fmt.channels);
}
```

| Backend   | Source of the report                                                                                                       |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WASAPI    | `IAudioClient::GetMixFormat` (the shared-mode mix engine's preferred format — typically 48 kHz f32 stereo on Windows-10/11). |
| CoreAudio | HAL `kAudioDevicePropertyNominalSampleRate` for the rate + `kAudioStreamPropertyVirtualFormat` on the device's first output stream for the channel count. Aggregate devices stay coherent (per-stream rates may disagree). |
| ALSA      | Throwaway `snd_pcm_open` in `NONBLOCK` mode + `snd_pcm_hw_params_any` to load the device's full param space, then `snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_near(48000)` and `snd_pcm_hw_params_set_channels_near(2)` to read the snapped values out of their mutable args — the same path the real `open()` walks. The PCM is closed before the call returns. |
| Others    | `Ok(None)` — PulseAudio simple API exposes no sink introspection; OSS's `SNDCTL_DSP_*` family is in-band (committing the values to the device) so there's no read-without-write path; PipeWire/ASIO are stubs. |

A backend without an introspection path surfaces as `Ok(None)` rather
than an error so callers can iterate every probed driver without
per-backend special-casing.

## Testing without hardware — the `mock` backend

The non-default cargo feature `mock` compiles in a virtual `"mock"`
driver (any OS, no audio library, no device) that renders the callback
from a paced worker thread into a discard — or capture — sink. It
registers **last** in the preference order, so a real backend still
wins whenever one works; it is kept out of the default feature set on
purpose, because with it enabled `probe()` never comes back empty,
which would change `open_default()`'s failure behaviour for ordinary
users.

It enumerates three virtual devices (`mock:default`, `mock:secondary`,
`mock:capture`), honours `buffer_frames` hints verbatim, rejects
fabricated device ids, models `latency()` as a fixed two-period
software queue, and advances `CallbackInfo::frames_played` one period
per callback while playing. Streams opened on `mock:capture` copy
every rendered (post volume-gain) sample into a bounded global sink
drained via `oxideav_sysaudio::mock::take_captured()` — this is how
the crate's own tests verify the render pipeline sample-exactly.

`tests/mock_backend.rs` drives the full public state machine through
it on hardware-free CI; `tests/hardware_smoke.rs` runs the same
lifecycle against the first *real* backend that probes and skips
cleanly on headless runners (set `OXIDEAV_SYSAUDIO_STRICT_HW=1`
locally to make environment-dependent observations hard failures).

## Non-goals (for now)

- **Audio capture / input streams.** Output only.
- **PulseAudio device enumeration.** The "simple" API exposes no sink
  introspection; it returns an empty list. The full async
  `pa_context_get_sink_info_list` path is a follow-up.
- **Sample formats other than f32** on the public callback surface.
  Backends convert internally where the hardware insists on S16 or
  similar.
