## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- Dropped the unused `thiserror` dependency — the crate's `Error` has
  hand-written `Display`/`Error` impls and nothing referenced the
  macro; it only added a proc-macro chain (`syn`/`quote`) to every
  consumer's cold build.

### Fixed

- *(example)* `sine.rs` carried its oscillator phase across callbacks
  through an `AtomicU64` with `p as u64` — truncating the fractional
  phase (a value kept in `[0, τ)`, so effectively resetting to an
  integer) at every period boundary, which detunes the tone and adds a
  periodic discontinuity. The phase now round-trips losslessly as f32
  bits in an `AtomicU32`.
- *(api)* `PartialEq for Driver` could report two **different**
  backends as equal: it compared only the data pointers of the
  `&'static dyn Backend` trait objects, but backends are zero-sized
  types behind const-promoted references, so distinct backends can
  share a data address (observed on the Linux/Windows CI runners,
  where `Driver(pipewire) == Driver(mock)` compared true — caught by
  the new `Driver::status()` consistency test). Equality now uses the
  backend name, which is unique per target and is the actual identity;
  a regression test asserts pairwise inequality across `drivers()`.
- *(coreaudio)* Device enumeration returned an **empty list on every
  host**: all four variable-length HAL queries (`hal_all_devices`,
  `hal_is_output_device`, `hal_first_output_stream`,
  `hal_device_name`) used `AudioObjectGetPropertyData` with a NULL
  `outData` pointer as a "size query", which is not a size query and
  fails on current macOS. Since `open()` / `latency()` use fixed-size
  queries, playback kept working and masked the bug —
  `output_devices()` reported no devices on a MacBook with working
  speakers, `default_output_device()` returned `Ok(None)`, and the
  per-stream HAL latency component silently dropped out of
  `latency()`. `CaLib` now also binds the HAL's dedicated
  `AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize` symbol and every size-then-data
  site uses it. Verified live: the built-in output enumerates with its
  name and default tag, and `latency()` gained the previously-lost
  stream-latency component. A hardware-gated regression unit test pins
  it (when the HAL reports a default output device, enumeration must
  contain it, tagged and named; headless runners skip cleanly).

### Added

- *(coreaudio)* `default_output_device()` now uses the HAL's direct
  `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice` query (one property read
  + one name lookup) instead of the trait default's
  enumerate-everything-and-filter reduction — the cheaper path the
  trait doc always envisaged. The crate-level cross-check test pins
  agreement between the two paths on real hardware.
- *(api)* Callback panic containment: a panic in the user callback is
  caught in the wrapper `open()` installs and never unwinds into the
  backend. This closes an undefined-behaviour hole — CoreAudio and
  WASAPI invoke the callback on an OS-owned audio thread, where
  unwinding across the foreign stack frame is UB, and on the
  worker-thread backends a panic silently killed the render loop. The
  panicked period is replaced with silence, the stream keeps running
  and stays controllable (`pause`/`stop`/drop), and the callback is
  never re-entered (an `FnMut` that panicked mid-mutation isn't safe
  to resume). Mock-backend test pins all of it: worker survives,
  post-panic output is pure silence including the partially-written
  panicking period, exactly one invocation, transport still works.
- *(tests)* Real-hardware lifecycle smoke test
  (`tests/hardware_smoke.rs`): one full open → play → latency → pause
  → resume → volume → drop cycle rendering silence through the first
  real (non-mock) backend that probes, dumping devices / preferred
  format / latency / teardown time. Headless runners skip cleanly
  (nothing probes). Pure-software invariants (sane negotiated format,
  transport calls return, teardown under 5 s) always assert;
  environment-dependent observations (callbacks arriving, latency
  reported) only assert under `OXIDEAV_SYSAUDIO_STRICT_HW=1` for local
  runs on known-good hardware. This test's device dump is what exposed
  the CoreAudio empty-enumeration bug above.
- *(api)* `Driver::status() -> DriverStatus` — one-call availability
  triage collapsing the three existing signals into a tri-state:
  `Ready` (probe succeeds; exactly the `probe()` set), `Stub`
  (compile-time placeholder, same signal as `is_stub()`), and
  `Unavailable(Error)` carrying the probe failure that `probe()`
  swallows — so a UI/diagnostic can finally show *why* a backend is
  unusable (`LibraryLoad` = not installed vs `DeviceOpen` = library
  loads but no device opens) without attempting a real `open()`.
  `DriverStatus` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, has a stable `Display`
  (`"ready"` / `"not yet implemented (stub)"` / `"unavailable: …"`)
  and an `is_ready()` convenience. Tests pin the exact correspondence
  with `is_stub()` + `probe()` membership across every compiled-in
  driver and the Display shapes.
- *(api)* Per-stream software volume: `Stream::set_volume(f32)` /
  `Stream::volume()`. A gain stage between the callback and the
  backend, stored as f32 bits in an atomic the audio thread reads
  wait-free; unity gain (the default) bypasses the multiply so the
  default path costs one relaxed load per period. `0.0` is silence,
  values above `1.0` amplify (may clip), negative/NaN clamp to `0.0`.
  Independent of — and composing with — the OS mixer volume. Verified
  end-to-end through the mock backend's capture sink (which observes
  post-gain samples, exactly what a real backend would receive):
  attenuation scales samples, zero silences, defaults/clamping pinned.
- *(api)* `Stream::is_playing()` — the last transport state
  successfully requested through the handle (`true` from `open()`
  since streams start playing, toggled by `play()`/`pause()`, `false`
  once stopped). Tracks requests, not a hardware query. `Stream` also
  gains a `Debug` impl.
- *(api)* Pre-flight request validation in `open()` (and therefore
  `open_default()` / `open_on()`): requests no backend could ever
  satisfy — `sample_rate == 0`, `channels == 0`,
  `buffer_frames == Some(0)` — are rejected up front with
  `Error::UnsupportedFormat`, uniformly across backends and before any
  shared library is loaded or device touched. Previously the failure
  mode depended on which driver won the probe (an OS error code at
  best, division-by-zero in a backend's period math at worst). A new
  unit test pins the contract across every compiled-in driver, stubs
  included; it is fully deterministic on headless CI because
  validation runs before any dlopen.
- *(mock)* New non-default cargo feature `mock`: a virtual,
  target-independent backend (`driver_by_name("mock")`) that renders
  the callback from a paced worker thread into a discard or capture
  sink, needing no audio hardware and no loadable library. It
  registers last in the preference order so a real backend always wins
  when one works, enumerates three virtual devices (`mock:default` /
  `mock:secondary` / `mock:capture`), honours `buffer_frames` hints
  verbatim, rejects fabricated device ids with `DeviceOpen`, models
  latency as a fixed two-period software queue, and advances the
  `CallbackInfo::frames_played` clock only while playing. Streams
  opened on `mock:capture` copy every rendered sample into a global
  bounded sink drained via `oxideav_sysaudio::mock::take_captured()`.
  A new integration suite (`tests/mock_backend.rs`) drives the whole
  public state machine through it on hardware-free CI runners:
  probing/registration order, enumeration + default-device agreement,
  preferred-format introspection, hinted buffer sizes, the monotonic
  frame clock (starts at zero, advances one period per callback),
  pause-halts/play-resumes semantics, prompt `stop()` even with a
  1-second buffer hint, drop-joins-the-worker teardown, per-device
  routing, latency, and capture fidelity. The CI shim now passes
  `extra_test_args: "--all-features"` so the suite actually runs on
  the headless matrix. The tests also codify a previously undocumented
  cross-backend contract: streams start in the **playing** state at
  `open()` (every real backend initialises its `paused` flag to
  false).
- *(api)* `Driver::is_stub() -> bool` — compile-time capability flag
  distinguishing backends that ship as placeholders (PipeWire on Linux,
  ASIO on Windows) from working backends whose shared library may or
  may not be installed on the current host. Both cases look identical
  through `probe()` alone (it fails for either reason); the new
  accessor closes the gap with a dedicated bit on the internal
  `Backend` trait, defaulting to `false` and overridden to `true` in
  the two stub modules. Useful for callers iterating `drivers()`
  (which includes stubs) to surface a per-backend UI label that
  distinguishes "not yet implemented" from "library not installed".
  Three unit tests pin the contract: the flag matches the documented
  set (only `pipewire` / `asio`), every stub fails `probe()` (the
  whole point of the flag), and nothing in `probe()`'s output is a
  stub (symmetric form catches the reverse regression).
- *(api)* `Driver::default_output_device() -> Result<Option<Device>>` —
  one-call shortcut for "the entry from `output_devices()` whose
  `is_default` flag is set", so a caller only interested in the current
  default endpoint doesn't have to materialise the full device list and
  filter. The default implementation on the internal `Backend` trait is
  exactly that reduction (every enumerating backend already tags the
  default entry), with room for backends to swap in a cheaper direct
  query later (CoreAudio's `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice`
  system-object selector, WASAPI's
  `IMMDeviceEnumerator::GetDefaultAudioEndpoint`). Public-layer mapping
  matches the rest of the surface: backends without an enumeration path
  (PulseAudio "simple" API, the not-yet-wired PipeWire/OSS/ASIO stubs)
  surface `Ok(None)` rather than an error so a caller can union
  per-driver results without per-backend special-casing. Three new unit
  tests pin the contract: `NotImplemented` is never leaked to the
  public surface, the shortcut agrees with the `is_default` entry from
  the enumeration (cross-check), and a `Some(_)` return always carries
  `is_default == true` (so a UI caller plumbing the returned `Device`
  into a label never mislabels it).
- *(oss)* OSS backend goes functional. `/dev/dsp` is opened directly via
  the Linux kernel UAPI (`<sys/soundcard.h>`); userspace surface is
  `open`/`close`/`write`/`ioctl` reached through `libloading` against
  `libc.so.6` / `libc.so` / `libc.musl-x86_64.so.1` so the produced
  binary still has no audio library in its NEEDED list. Format
  negotiation goes through `SNDCTL_DSP_SETFMT` (AFMT_S16_LE — the one
  format every OSS-emulator on top of ALSA advertises),
  `SNDCTL_DSP_CHANNELS`, and `SNDCTL_DSP_SPEED`; the worker thread
  converts the public f32 callback samples to S16_LE before each
  `write(2)`. `Stream::pause` skips the user callback and writes silence
  (OSS has no soft-cork); `Stream::stop` issues `SNDCTL_DSP_RESET` to
  drop the tail buffer rather than blocking on drain. `Stream::latency`
  queries `SNDCTL_DSP_GETODELAY` for the live queued output-byte count
  and converts it to time using the negotiated S16_LE frame size and sample
  rate; OSS implementations that reject the ioctl fall back to one worker
  period. Per-device routing falls out
  of OSS's naming convention: `StreamRequest::with_device("/dev/dsp1")`
  binds the stream to an alternate character device. The ioctl request
  numbers are computed at const time via a local `_IOC(dir, type, nr,
  size)` packing function so the values are derived from the kernel
  ABI macro rather than transcribed hex; unit tests then assert the
  derivation against the documented `_IOWR('P', N, int)` results
  (0xC0045002 / 0xC0045005 / 0xC0045006 for SPEED / SETFMT /
  CHANNELS). OSS stays last in the Linux probe order — every modern
  distro's `/dev/dsp` is an emulator on top of ALSA, so opening ALSA
  directly bypasses one level of indirection when both are present.
  Closes the long-standing OSS-stub non-goal.
- *(alsa)* `preferred_format` now wired. A throwaway `snd_pcm_open` in
  `NONBLOCK` mode + `snd_pcm_hw_params_any` loads the device's full
  hw_params space, then `snd_pcm_hw_params_set_rate_near(48000)` and
  the newly-resolved `snd_pcm_hw_params_set_channels_near(2)` write the
  device's snapped rate / channel count back through their mutable args
  — exactly the same path the real `open()` walks, just without
  committing the params or starting the worker. The PCM is closed
  before the call returns so a follow-up real `open()` against the same
  device doesn't contend with the probe. Old libasound that lacks
  `set_channels_near` degrades to "channels = 2" rather than erroring
  the load (consistent with the existing degradation pattern for the
  hint API). Closes the previous ALSA gap in the sample-rate
  negotiation read-back table.
- *(api)* sample-rate negotiation read-back via
  `Driver::preferred_format(Option<&Device>) -> Result<Option<StreamFormat>>`.
  Returns the rate / channels / format the backend would settle on for an
  unconstrained `open()` against the system default (`None`) or the
  enumerated endpoint — so callers can resample on their side once and
  skip the OS mixer's hidden conversion. WASAPI reads
  `IAudioClient::GetMixFormat` (= the shared-mode mix engine's
  preferred format, typically 48 kHz f32 stereo on Windows-10/11);
  CoreAudio reads the HAL property
  `kAudioDevicePropertyNominalSampleRate` (`'nsrt'`) for the rate and
  `kAudioStreamPropertyVirtualFormat` (`'sfmt'`) on the device's first
  output stream for the channel count, so aggregate devices stay
  coherent. Backends without an introspection path (PulseAudio simple
  API, ALSA, the PipeWire/OSS/ASIO stubs) report `Ok(None)` so callers
  can iterate every driver without per-backend special-casing.
- *(wasapi, pulse)* honour `StreamRequest::buffer_frames` on every
  functional backend. WASAPI translates the hint into the
  `REFERENCE_TIME` (100 ns ticks) value `IAudioClient::Initialize`
  consumes via `frames × 10_000_000 / sample_rate` with `i128` widening
  (so a 30-min hint at 192 kHz still fits without overflow and a
  sub-millisecond hint rounds up to at least one tick); `None` keeps the
  historical ~200 ms target. PulseAudio fills a `pa_buffer_attr` with
  `tlength` set to the requested byte count and `minreq` set to roughly
  one period (capped at `tlength` so the server doesn't reject
  `minreq > tlength`); the worker's write size follows the hint so
  client and server stay aligned. ALSA and CoreAudio already wired the
  hint in prior rounds — every functional backend now covers it.
- *(coreaudio)* per-device routing now wired. The numeric `AudioDeviceID`
  exposed in `Device::id` is resolved through the HAL property
  `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceUID` to a CFStringRef, then handed to
  `AudioQueueSetProperty(queue, kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentDevice, &cfstr)`
  before `AudioQueueStart`. CoreFoundation is `dlopen`'d at runtime
  through a new minimal `CfLib` (only `CFRelease`) so the no-link-time-deps
  invariant still holds — no `objc`, no `core-foundation` crate, the
  produced binary lists nothing CF-related in its load commands. The HAL
  latency query (`latency()`) now follows the bound device when one was
  set, so the figure stays correct on USB DACs / Bluetooth headphones
  routed via `open_on`. Non-numeric `Device::id` strings (callers
  fabricating ids, or routing strings from another backend) surface as
  `Error::UnsupportedFormat` rather than silently falling back to the
  system default. Closes the previous "CoreAudio per-device routing"
  non-goal.
- *(api)* per-device opening: `StreamRequest::with_device(id)` (and the
  underlying `StreamRequest::device: Option<String>`) plus the free
  `open_on(driver, &device, req, cb)` convenience. Closes the previous
  "non-default device" non-goal — callers can pipe an enumerated
  `Device::id` straight back into `open()`. ALSA routes the id as the
  PCM name to `snd_pcm_open`; PulseAudio passes it as the `dev` arg of
  `pa_simple_new`; WASAPI resolves it through
  `IMMDeviceEnumerator::GetDevice` (LPWSTR); CoreAudio resolves the
  numeric `AudioDeviceID` to a CFString UID via the HAL and binds the
  AudioQueue with `kAudioQueueProperty_CurrentDevice` (see the
  *(coreaudio)* entry above). `StreamRequest` is now `Clone` (no longer
  `Copy`) so it can carry an owned `String` id.
- *(api)* output-device enumeration: `Device { id, name, is_default }`,
  `Driver::output_devices()` and the free `output_devices(driver)`. Each
  backend lists its playback endpoints with the OS-friendly name and a
  flag for the system default; backends that can only reach the default
  (PulseAudio "simple", the PipeWire/OSS/ASIO stubs) return an empty list
  rather than an error so callers can union across drivers.
- *(alsa)* enumerate via `snd_device_name_hint("pcm")`, filtered to
  `IOID=Output`/duplex; PCM `NAME` is the `id`, the first `DESC` line the
  friendly name, `"default"` tagged as the system default. The malloc'd
  hint strings are released through a runtime-resolved libc `free` (no
  `libc` crate — same no-link-time-deps premise as the rest).
- *(wasapi)* enumerate active render endpoints via
  `IMMDeviceEnumerator::EnumAudioEndpoints(eRender, DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE)`,
  reading `PKEY_Device_FriendlyName` from each `IPropertyStore` and
  tagging the `GetDefaultAudioEndpoint` match. New hand-rolled
  `IMMDeviceCollection` / `IPropertyStore` vtables + a minimal
  `PROPVARIANT`, freed with `PropVariantClear`.
- *(coreaudio)* enumerate via HAL `kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices`, keeping
  devices that expose output streams, labelling each with the
  CFString-free `kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceName`, and tagging
  `kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice`.
- *(wasapi)* query real end-to-end output latency via `IAudioClock::GetPosition`
  + cached `GetFrequency`. The worker publishes
  `(frames_written - position_in_frames) / sample_rate` after each
  `ReleaseBuffer`, giving callers the live total-pipeline delay (mix
  engine + driver + device hardware) on Bluetooth, HDMI passthrough,
  and remote-desktop sinks rather than the driver-side `GetStreamLatency`
  estimate alone. Falls back to `GetStreamLatency + GetCurrentPadding`
  when the driver shim refuses the `IAudioClock` service or
  `GetFrequency` returns 0.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-sysaudio/compare/v0.0.1...v0.1.0) - 2026-04-19

### Other

- bump to 0.1.0

### Added

- Initial release: pure-Rust audio output framework with runtime-loaded
  native backends via `libloading`.
- Linux: functional ALSA (`libasound.so.2`) and PulseAudio
  (`libpulse-simple.so.0`) backends. PipeWire and OSS stubbed.
- Windows: functional WASAPI backend via `ole32.dll` + `kernel32.dll`
  (COM vtables by hand, shared-mode, event-driven). ASIO stubbed.

- Public API: `drivers()`, `probe()`, `default_driver()`,
  `driver_by_name()`, `open()`, `open_default()`,

- `Stream::latency()` reports output-side delay per backend
  (PulseAudio end-to-end, ALSA `snd_pcm_delay`, WASAPI
  `GetStreamLatency` + padding, CoreAudio software estimate) so
  callers can compensate A/V sync on high-latency sinks like
  Bluetooth.
