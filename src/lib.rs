//! Pure-Rust audio output with runtime-loaded native backends.
//!
//! `oxideav-sysaudio` talks to the platform's audio stack through
//! `libloading` instead of linking against audio system libraries at
//! build time. The produced binary has no `libasound`, `libpulse`,
//! `ole32`, or `AudioToolbox` entry in its NEEDED list — everything is
//! `dlopen`'d on first use and the backends fall through to each other
//! gracefully if a library is missing.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use oxideav_sysaudio::{open_default, StreamRequest};
//!
//! let req = StreamRequest::new(48_000, 2);
//! let mut stream = open_default(req, |out, _info| {
//!     // Fill `out` with interleaved f32 samples in [-1.0, 1.0].
//!     out.fill(0.0);
//! })
//! .expect("no audio driver available");
//! // The stream is already playing — open() returns it running.
//! // pause()/play() toggle it; set_volume() adjusts a software gain.
//! stream.pause().ok();
//! stream.play().ok();
//! // ... audio plays for the lifetime of `stream` ...
//! ```
//!
//! # Driver probing and explicit selection
//!
//! [`probe()`] returns the subset of compiled-in backends whose shared
//! library loads and whose device opens cleanly, ordered by platform
//! preference. [`default_driver()`] is the first entry of that list.
//! Callers that need to force a specific backend pass a [`Driver`] to
//! [`open()`]; [`drivers()`] enumerates every compiled-in backend
//! (including ones whose library isn't installed).
